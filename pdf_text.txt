INDUS EXPRESS
Located on the lobby level of the hotel, our fine dining restaurant, Indus Express, traces a vintage
journey across pre-Partition, undivided India’s North-West Frontier. The menu is an exceptional
treasure trove of home-style recipes from Kashmir, Pothovar (present-day Peshawar),
Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Khyber and Lahore. The restaurant name is derived from the five rivers –
Jhelum, Sutlej, Beas, Ravi and Chenab- which flow through the Indus basin region, creating a
robust food trail. Family recipes from along this trail have been patiently researched and
recreated by our chefs, using fresh hand-pounded masalas (spice mixes), complex cooking
techniques which - often, literally - involve a trial by fire and bucketfuls of soul. The restaurant’s
all-white interiors, dotted with copper bartans (utensils), colonial-era maps and miniature trains,
plus an alfresco section for aperitifs and conversations, build an atmosphere that prepares diners
for a unique voyage, flagged off with signature exotic seeds and spice-infused almond milk drink,
Khyber-ki-sardai. While meat-lovers can expect the ride of a lifetime, vegetarians cruise along on
smoked and spiced aubergine, rare gucchi (morel) mushroom and lotus stem delicacies, all paired
with international wines. Regular specials and a chef’s table keep the Indus Express journey full
of surprises with distant memories recreated at every stop.

SIGNATURE  EXPERIENCES
THE KABIR WALL
A short walk from the hotel lobby en route to Indus Express restaurant takes guests on
a rich and soulful journey that integrates urbane design, technology, art and philosophy
on a 60 ft. wall. The Kabir Wall is an exceptional collaboration between students,
artists and scholars of Sant Kabir, a 15th-century Indian mystic and poet whose
timeless couplets (dohas) are as - if not more - relevant to contemporary times as they
were centuries ago. The dohas are scripted on the wall using entirely handcrafted
calligraphy and illustrations while 3D software allows you to listen to a modern
narrative driven by the soft power of Sufi mysticism at a striking and comfortable
audio pod (an English translation is available in both print and audio-visual form). It is
no coincidence that the Kabir Wall precedes Indus Express restaurant; the North-West
Frontier province in an undivided India was where the mystic-saint travelled widely.
Kabir’s philosophy is deceptively simple and homegrown and is known to impact and
resonate with everyone, from our jet-setting business travellers – who view the
experience as a crash course in leadership - to families and children, inviting each
participant to silently look within and seek his/her purpose in life, The Kabir Wall is a
quiet triumph of technology, design and globally-relevant Indian philosophy.
THE INDUS EXPRESS SAMPLER
We believe that if there’s anything that beats great storytelling, it’s great food. At our
North-West Frontier cuisine fine dining restaurant, Indus Express, we’ve combined two
of everyone’s biggest passions for a unique experience. Diners can book the chef’s
table for a legendary meal that travels back in time, chugging through the Indus basin
in undivided India – stopping for sumptuous courses at Kashmir, Pothovar (present-day
Peshawar), Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Khyber and Lahore. Miniature toy trains – a
permanent element of the restaurant décor – appear to whistle in the background as
our chefs precede each course with its fascinating history. Traditional moon-shaped
copper thalis (platters) and katoris (bowls) are filled with slow-cooked curries, robust
racks of lamb, juicy kebabs marinated with secret spice mixes, flatbreads bubbling hot
from traditional clay ovens and sinfully rich desserts. The storytelling takes delightful
turns along with your taste buds. Often, a simple vegetarian dish like the Farmer’s
Lentil Curry reveals a complex provenance –rajma (kidney beans) from Kashmir,
masoor (puy lentils) from central Asia, urad (split black gram) from Khyber, and matki
(moth beans) from Punjab - cooked over hours to create a soulful dal. Meanwhile, our
sommelier pairs each course with fine international wines, enhancing the spices and
adding a further dimension to the meals. For a lively history lesson in tandem with a
feast fit for global gourmands, book a berth on Indus Express right away.
DINE UNDER THE STARS
Delhi’s overwhelming urban landscape can often get seem like the furthest thing from
romance, but we delight in presenting our guests with the unexpected. Spring a
surprise on your better half with an old-school rendezvous under the stars. Leave the
planning hassles to our staff; they’ll set up a chic cabana on the manicured lawn or by

barbecue. All you have to do is dress like stars and show up for a lavish meal and
laughter punctuated by moonlit silences and the gentle breeze. Whether you’re

experience is exactly what Cupid ordered.
BLUE LINE METRO MENU
Vivanta New Delhi, Dwarka’s commitment to bringing you the quintessential Delhi
experience ranges from recreating a slice of the city’s world-class art scene to bringing
the flavours off our vibrant streets into the hotel. The Blue Line Metro Menu – served
at our all-day diner, Creo – borrows its name from the underground metro line that
passes by the hotel. Well versed with the city’s spiciest and sauciest secrets, our chefs
have handpicked street food icons from each station to string together a fast-paced,
zingy ride for diners – minus any risk of the infamous Delhi Belly. 
From the ram laddoo (deep-fried lentil dumplings served with crispy salad) sold in the
lanes outside Yamuna Bank to Karol Bagh’s moong dal chilla (lentil pancake stuffed
with vegetables and paneer), Subhash Nagar’s aloo tikki chaat (crisp, stuffed potato
galettes) and Janakpuri’s chole kulcha (chickpeas cooked Amritsar-style and served

legends are lined up to delight the secret glutton in you.
